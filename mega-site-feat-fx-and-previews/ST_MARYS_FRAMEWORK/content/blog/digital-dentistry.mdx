Digital technologies are transforming the way dental treatments are planned and delivered. In the past, impressions were taken with uncomfortable trays and materials; now we use intraoral scanners to capture precise 3D models of your teeth and gums in seconds. These digital scans are then imported into advanced CAD/CAM software, allowing our clinicians to design restorations, orthodontic aligners, and treatment guides with exceptional accuracy and efficiency.

Once the design phase is complete, our on-site milling and 3D printing equipment fabricates crowns, veneers, surgical guides and even aligners from high-strength ceramics or resin materials. The result is a more comfortable experience with fewer appointments and a precise fit tailored to your anatomy. Digital workflows also improve communication with dental laboratories and specialists, ensuring everyone involved has access to the same accurate data. As a patient, you benefit from faster turnarounds, predictable outcomes and the ability to preview your treatment results before committing. At St Maryâ€™s House Dental Care we continually invest in state-of-the-art digital tools to provide you with the highest standard of care.
