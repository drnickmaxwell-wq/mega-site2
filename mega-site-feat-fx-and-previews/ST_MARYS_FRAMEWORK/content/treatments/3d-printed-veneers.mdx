Advances in digital dentistry mean you no longer have to wait weeks for a beautiful new smile. 3D printed veneers use CAD/CAM technology and high-quality resin materials to create ultra-thin shells that bond seamlessly to the front surface of your teeth. We take a digital scan of your mouth, design the veneers to suit your facial features and bite, then print them in-house while you relax. Once fitted, the veneers immediately transform the appearance of worn, chipped or discoloured teeth with a natural shape and shade.

Because the process is fully digitised, adjustments can be made quickly, ensuring a precise fit without the need for messy impressions or temporary coverings. The materials we use are biocompatible and durable, so your new smile can last for years when cared for properly. 3D printed veneers are particularly suited to patients seeking a minimally invasive solution with rapid results. During your consultation we’ll discuss your goals and show you a digital preview so you can visualise your new smile before treatment begins. In a single appointment, you’ll leave the practice with a confident, rejuvenated smile.
